# Release Process

## Code
1. Generate the change log using the script changelog.sh. The script must be run from the repo root directory (ie ./scripts/changelog.sh <commit to start from> <new version>)
2. Update all package.json files to define the new version, eg 0.7.0 and regen package-lock.json (PR 1)
3. create a release on Github with the changelog details and mark it pre-release
4. Update all the package.json files to define a new unstable version, eg 0.7.1-unstable and regen package-lock.json (PR 2)

## Docs
1. from the gh-pages branch, edit the docs in vNext to point to the next caliper versions (eg 0.7.0 and 0.7.1-unstable etc)
2. update docs.json with the new caliper version and run the script bump-docs.js (PR 3)

## Caliper benchmarks
1. Create a release in caliper-benchmarks corresponding to the new release, eg 0.7.0

## Documentation Deployment

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of documentation to GitHub Pages whenever a new version is tagged. Follow the steps below to change the version and deploy updated documentation.

### Steps to Change Version and Deploy Documentation

1. Create a Git Tag for the New Version

To deploy a new version of the documentation, start by creating a Git tag. For example:

```bash
git tag v1.2
```

2. Push the Tag to GitHub
Once the tag is created, push it to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin v1.2.3
```

Pushing the tag will automatically trigger the GitHub Actions CI pipeline defined in the .github/workflows/publish-doc.yml file.

3. CI Pipeline Actions
When the tag is pushed, the CI pipeline will execute the following steps:

Checkout Code: The latest version of the repository is pulled.
Setup Python: Python 3.x is set up and the required dependencies are installed from the docs/pip-requirements.txt.
Deploy Documentation: The mike deploy command is used to deploy the documentation to the gh-pages branch under the new version folder (/v1.2.3/).

4. Access the Documentation
The updated documentation can be accessed through GitHub Pages. The URL format will be:

```bash
https://hyperledger-caliper.github.io/caliper/
```
